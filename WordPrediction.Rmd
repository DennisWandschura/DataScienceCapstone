```

## Goal

- Create a text model to predict the next words based on input
- Needs to run as shiny app
- Target mobile devices
    - Limits memory
    - Prediction needs to be fast
    
## Creating the model

- N-gram model
  - Apply transforms on training text
  - Tokenize
  - Create n-grams
  - Compute probabilities
- Stupid backoff to smooth between levels

## Predicting

- Apply transforms on input text
- Tokenize input text
- Create n-grams
- Use model to lookup the next likely words

## The App

- <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
- Easy to use
- Write text
- Get the most likely next 3 words
